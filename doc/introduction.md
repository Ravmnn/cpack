## Introduction

Welcome to *cppack*'s official documentation. Here you can learn everything you need to start using *cppack* like a pro. If you wanna a quick start on the basics, see [Quick Start](/doc/quick_start.md).

## Pseudo Syntax Language

This documentation uses a pseudo syntax language for describing the syntax of subcommands. It's not hard and you probably can understand it even without knowing anything about it. Here's a brief explanation of it though:

`cppack subcommand subsubcommand [option] [optionalOption]?`

- `subcommand` and `subsubcommand`: literal text.
- `[option]`: describes a mandatory option.
- `[optionalOptions]?`: describes an optional options; you can omit its value.
